- remove dep on tjr_btree (and j.st. core) by moving required defns to
  tjr_fs_shared (monad, basic types? perhaps block type has to come
  from isa_btree?)

- add block_list_length to test ops (find add detach...)
  - but on reflection, this is ideally not part of the spec, since it
    ties us to a fixed number of ops per block
