- add block_list_length to test ops (find add detach...)
  - but on reflection, this is ideally not part of the spec, since it
    ties us to a fixed number of ops per block

- use with_state rather than refs, for code which is serialized (which
  is all this code!)


- more testing of pl and pcl

- prefer tjr exhaustive testing to make_checked_dcl_ops

- at the moment pcl combines contents-as-list with marshalling; split?
